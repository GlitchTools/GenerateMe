Detailed instructions inside scripts

List:
  * decayscreen - decay image, based on XScreenSaver hack with the same name
  * drawing_generative - draw image using strokes based on channel value
  * drawing_strokes - draw image using lines (aka robot drawing)
  * fractalify - draw mandelbrot/julia fractals using channel data from image
  * imagelens - use image channel data to displace pixels. You can use different image as lens and to process.
  * mirrorimage - mirror parts of the image to other parts, 24 modes for rectangular (12 for squared) images
  * ntsc_analogtv - xanalogtv XScreenSaver hack ported to processing
  * slitscan - simulate errors during scanning (more digital way)
  * wzipprocess2 - recompress image using wzip method (Haar wavelet transformation)
  * imageslicer - few algorithms based on segmentation of the image
